## re.findall()

Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.

```python
# A Python program to demonstrate working of 
# findall() 
import re 
    
# A sample text string where regular expression  
# is searched. 
string = """Hello my Number is 123456789 and 
             my friend's number is 987654321"""
    
# A sample regular expression to find digits. 
regex = '\d+'             
    
match = re.findall(regex, string) 
print(match) 
```

```
Output:

['123456789', '987654321']

```
