> Today I Learned üìù

This is a collection of short notes and codeblocks across different technologies that make me see the world afresh.

It's a kind of note to myself and a flashback to things that I keep on learning. 

I first got this idea from [Shawn Wang's](https://www.swyx.io/) blog [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).
